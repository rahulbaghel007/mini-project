Learing --> Routing (Watch and search twice in free time) 
1. Creating Component ==> Good Practice -> Create folder for every Component
2. Creating Component ==> Method 1
                            1. routing every Component in App.jsx and calling in main.jsx \
                            2. using array and object in it and then specifing the path and element
                          Method 2
                            1. using createRouteFromElement and using Route in it
                            2. Simple nesting the path one by one in Route by using <Route path="/" element={<About />}> </Route>
3. useParams for getting the values from someplaces ---> used in facebook and Insta for seaching the result and displaying the seached user from the database
4. Github Component -> we are fetching the data from the API and call it and displaying on the DOM via useState Hook
When we have to call any Method when the Component is render we use HOOKKKKKKK -> useEffect Hook of React.
5. Loader --> new concept which help in optimization for calling any api from website or fetching it from database.
        Concept of Asynchronus come into Practice
        this Loader start even before useEffect--> As we mouse hover over the Component button. Loader automatically start working accordingly in parallel to fetch the data from api before clicking to render the Component it.
